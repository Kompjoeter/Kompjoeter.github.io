This weekend I started working on a new <a href="https://github.com/Kompjoeter/TopDown-Grid">pet project. </a> I'm making a topdown game-engine type thing, or at least that's the direction I expect it go. So far I've set up a grid-map and a simple camera. You can navigate the map using WASD controls.<br><br>The code is working-code still, it can probably be improved upon, so beware if you want to use it yourself.<br><br><a href="https://kompjoeter.github.io/TopDown-Grid/">Live Project</a>
