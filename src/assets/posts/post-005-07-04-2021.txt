This weekend I started working on a <a href="https://github.com/Kompjoeter/TopDown-Grid"topdown game-engine type thing.</a> So far I've set up a grid-map and a simple camera. You can navigate the map using WASD controls.<br><br>The code is working-code, it can probably be improved upon, but it does the trick. Whenever I have I'll definitely  be adding onto this project.
