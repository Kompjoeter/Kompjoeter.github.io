<u>This</u> is a <span style='background-color: #484848; color: #eee;
padding: 0px 4px;'> <b>special block of text</b>.</span>
I can make my text <b>bold</b> or <i>italic</i> and even use inline styling or
add clickable links, by including HTML tags inside this string. <br><br>Now in
<a href='https://vuejs.org/'><b>VueJS</b></a> (Which I used to create this)
you normally use double brackets '<b>{{}}</b>' to dynamically bind your string props to
your HTML, displaying them as plain text. Or you can put your text staight into a component and 
decide which HTML tags to use inside of it, given that you want it to be harcoded. <br><br>
In my case I need to bind the content of my post dynamically, since I don't know
what I'm going to write beforehand and I want to use the
same component for every blog-post. Now if I want to <b><i><u>emphasize</u></i></b>
some of the words or sentences of my post by using HTML, binding my props by simply
using '<b>{{}}</b>' won't do. If I'd do that with this string my HTML tags wouldn't
work and would have been visible like &#60;b&#62;this&#60;/b&#62;.<br><br>
To make the HTML tags inside my string actually do their HTML-thing, I can use 
<a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/syntax.html#Raw-HTML"><b>'&#60;v-html&#62;'</b></a> 
onto a <b>'&#60;span&#62;'</b> and then bind my string to this span using <b>'{{}}'</b>.<br><br>
The string containing the content of this post looks like
