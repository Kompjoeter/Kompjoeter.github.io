Today I implemented dynamic post binding. I bascially used the same method 
I applied to an earlier <a href="https://kompjoeter.github.io/Github-Hosted-Blog/"><b>blog project</b></a> of mine. Although a bit more simple.
<br><br>I also reworked the placement of my avatar and titles and I've refactored the avatar binding.
