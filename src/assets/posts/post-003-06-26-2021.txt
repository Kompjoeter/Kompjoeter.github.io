Today I implemented dynamic post binding to Kompjoeter. I bascially used the same method I applied to an earlier <a href="https://kompjoeter.github.io/Github-Hosted-Blog/"><b>blog project</b></a> of mine. I did have to refactor it a little to make it work with Vue.<br><br>Basically I <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch">fetch</a> a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kompjoeter/kompjoeter.github.io/development/src/assets/posts/posts.json">JSON file</a> from my <a href="https://github.com/Kompjoeter">github</a> which contains an array of my blogposts. Each index holds an object containing my post data (title, date, author) and a link to where I stored a .txt file containing the actual content of the post. After fetching I bind this data to my posts.<br><br>I also reworked the placement of my avatar and titles and I've refactored the avatar binding.
