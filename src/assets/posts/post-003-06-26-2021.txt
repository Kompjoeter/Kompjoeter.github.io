Today I implemented dynamic post binding. I bascially used the same method 
I applied to an earlier <a href="https://kompjoeter.github.io/Github-Hosted-Blog/"><b>blog project</b></a> of mine, although a bit simpler. 
Basically I grab a json file from my github which contains an array of my blogposts. Each index holds an object containing my post data (title, date, author)
and a link to where I stored a .txt file containing the actual content of the post. After fetching I bind this data to my posts.
<br><br>I also reworked the placement of my avatar and titles and I've refactored the avatar binding.
